# Monster Rolodex

Uses a filter component to display monster cards from an initial list of monsters.
## Tech Stack

This project uses create-react-app. I added an input component that filters out from an initial list of monsters. The monsters are represented by monster cards with images and text for each one.

The code from the App.js page shows the functional component for App and uses React hooks to set and change the state. Underneath the code is how I created the original file using class components and lifecycle methods. This part of the code is commented out for reference.
